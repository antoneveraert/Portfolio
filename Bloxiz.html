                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        Bloxiz is a Tamagochi style game where you take care of your own little blocky creature. You acquire your creature by scanning a QR code, it will then be added to your collection. You can then take care of it by feeding it, playing with it cleaning it
                        and playing with it. You can breed these creatures and through a genetics system they will take traits of the parents this way you can try and collect any mix or any complete bloxiz. The game was made to the specifications of the
                        client.

                    <p style="text-align: left;">
                        During this project I took on the role of Lead Programmer, planning out the technical aspects of the game and overseeing the implementation of features. I worked closely with the team to ensure that the game mechanics were engaging and fun, while also
                        meeting the client's requirements. I was responsible for implementing the controls, creature care mechanics, and the QR code integration for creature acquisition. My focus was on creating a smooth user experience and ensuring that
                        all technical aspects of the game functioned correctly. I also closely worked together with the project manager and took over for him when he was not available. Scheduling and reporting meetings, as well as keeping the team on
                        track with the project timeline.
